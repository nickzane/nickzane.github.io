The lore might consist of current tales, forgotten stories, or even secret lore that has never been widely known. If the thing named is not of legendary importance, no information is gained. The more information already possessed about the thing, the more precise and detailed the information received is. The information learned is accurate but might be couched in figurative language. For example, if a mysterious magic axe is on hand, the spell might yield this information - “Woe to the evildoer whose hand touches the axe, for even the haft slices the hand of the evil ones.

Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of the description. If the spell ends before finishing the described modified memories, the Creature’s memory are not altered. Otherwise, the modified memories take hold when the spell ends. A modified memory does not necessarily affect how a Creature behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the Creature’s natural inclinations, alignment, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such as implanting a memory of how much the Creature enjoyed dousing itself in acid, is dismissed, perhaps as a bad dream. The GM might deem a modified memory too nonsensical to affect a Creature in a significant manner.

At the completion of the casting, the target makes a CHA save or is bound to serve this Caster for a day. If the Creature was summoned or created by another spell, that spell’s duration is extended to match the duration of this spell. A bound Creature must follow instructions to the best of its ability. For example, command the Creature to accompany them on an adventure, to guard a location, or to deliver a message. The Creature obeys the letter of instructions, but if the Creature is hostile, it strives to twist the words to achieve its own objectives.

This spell does not remove magical diseases, curses, or similar effects if these aren’t first removed prior to casting the spell. The spell cannot return an undead Creature to life. This spell closes all mortal wounds except missing body parts. If the Creature is lacking body parts or organs integral for its survival the spell automatically fails.

    { name:'heroes’ feast', desc:'For 10 minutes of casting and a gem-encrusted bowl worth at least 1000 GP, this Caster brings forth a great feast, including magnificent food and drink. The feast takes 1 hour to consume and disappears at the end of that time, and the beneficial effects do not set in until this hour is over. Up to 12 Creatures can partake of the feast. A Creature that partakes of the feast gains several benefits. The Creature is cured of all diseases and poison, becomes immune to poison and being frightened, and makes all WIS saves with advantage. Its HP MAX also increases by 2d10, and it gains the same number of HP. These benefits last for 24 hours', entry:'spell 3(6) 5e (conjuration)' },

At any time thereafter, using an action to crush the sapphire and speak the item’s name causes the item to appear in hand or within 5’ (Character’s Choice) regardless of physical or planar distances. If the item is being held or carried at the moment of this casting, the item remains where it was but whoever crushed the gem now knows where it is and who is in possession of it.

A dancing Creature uses all its movement to dance without leaving the location where it dances and gains disadvantage on DEX saves and attack rolls. While affected by this spell, other Creatures gain advantage on attack rolls against it. As an action, a dancing Creature makes a WIS save to regain control of itself, ending the spell', entry:'spell 3(6) 5e (enchantment)' },
    { name:'magic jar', desc:'For 1 minute of casting and and a gem, crystal, reliquary, or some other ornamental container worth at least 500 GP, this Caster’s body enters a catatonic state as their soul departs and inhabits the chosen container, which is this spell’s material component. While the soul inhabits the container, it remains aware of its surroundings but cannot move or use reactions. The only action available is to project the soul up to 100’, either returning to the Caster’s living body (thus ending the spell) or attempting to possess a Creature with a similar limb arrangement, within that range. Creatures protected by spells like protection from evil and good or magic circle cannot be possessed, but the Caster can make an attempt to possess any seen Creature within the specified range. The target makes a CHA save, or the Caster’s soul will transfer into the target body while the target’s soul becomes trapped in the container. Otherwise, efforts to possess the target fail, and so do attempts to possess it again for 1 day. Once the Caster possesses a Creature’s body, they gain full control over it, replacing the Creature’s statistics with their own alignment, INT, WIS, CHA, and type related abilities. Meanwhile, the possessed Creature’s soul can perceive the world from the container, using its own senses, but it remains immobile and unable to take any actions. To return from the host body to the container, the Caster must use an action. If the host body dies while the Caster’s soul is inside it, the Caster makes a CHA save against their own spell save TN. Success allows them to return to the container, failure results in the Caster’s death. If the container is destroyed or the spell’s duration ends, the possessing soul immediately returns to its original body, and any soul inside the container returns to its own body. When attempting to return, if one or more of the bodies are deceased, possessed by another soul, or more than 100’ away from the container, it leads to the death of one or both individuals, depending on the availability of a suitable body. When the spell ends, the container destroys itself', entry:'spell 3(6) 5e (necromancy)' },
    { name:'mass suggestion', desc:'Magically influence up to 12 seen Creatures within 60’ that can hear and understand the Caster, for 1 unfocused day, with a few spoken sentences. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the Creature to harm, or do some other obviously directly damaging act, or harm itself, automatically negates the effect of the spell. Each target makes a WIS save or it pursues the course of action described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do. Specify conditions that will trigger any special activity during the duration. For example, the suggestion might be that a group of soldiers give all their money to the first beggar they meet. If the condition is not met before the spell ends, the activity is not performed. If the caster or any of their companions damage a Creature affected by this spell, the spell ends for that Creature', entry:'spell 3(6) 5e (enchantment)' },
    { name:'move earth', desc:'For up to 2 hours focus, an area of seen terrain within 120’ no larger than 40’ on a side is reshaped, and any dirt, sand, or clay in the area takes any form this Caster chooses. Raise or lower the elevation, create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The extent of any such changes cannot exceed half the area’s largest dimension. So, if affecting a 40’ square, create a pillar up to 20’ high, raise or lower the elevation by up to 20’, dig a trench up to 20’ deep, and so on. It takes 10 minutes for these changes to complete. At the end of every 10 minute’s focus spent on the spell, this Caster can choose a new area of terrain to affect. Because the terrain transformation occurs slowly, Creatures in the area cannot usually be trapped or injured by the movement. This spell cannot manipulate natural stone or stone construction. Rocks and structures shift to accommodate the new terrain. However, if the way the terrain is shaped would make a structure unstable, it may collapse. Similarly, this spell does not directly affect plant growth. The moved earth carries any plants along with it', entry:'spell 3(6) 5e (transmutation)' },
    { name:'planar ally', desc:'For 10 minutes of casting, beseech an otherworldly entity for aid. The being must be known to this Caster - a god, a primordial, a demon prince, or some other being of cosmic power. That entity sends a celestial, an elemental, or a fiend loyal to it to aid, making the Creature appear in an unoccupied space within 60’. A specific Creature’s name spoken when casting this spell may request that Creature, though a different Creature may appear anyway (GM’s choice). When the Creature appears, it is under no compulsion to behave in any particular way. Ask the Creature to perform a service in exchange for payment, but it is not obliged to do so. The requested task could range from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help us fight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemies, or protect us during our foray into the dungeon). Ability to communicate with the Creature is necessary to bargain for its services. Payment can take a variety of forms. A celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some Creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by this Party. As a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth 100 GP per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1000 GP per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10000 GP per day. These payments are based on the circumstances under which the spell is cast. If the task is aligned with the Creature’s ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal. After the Creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration of service expires, the Creature returns to its home plane after reporting back, if possible and appropriate to the task. A party unable to agree on a price for the Creature’s service causes the Creature to immediately return to its home plane. A Creature enlisted to join a group counts as a member of it, receiving a full share of experience points awarded', entry:'spell 3(6) 5e (conjuration)' },
    { name:'programmed illusion', desc:'While possessing a bit of fleece and jade dust worth at least 25 GP, create an illusion of an object, a Creature, or some other visible phenomenon, at a seen point within 120’, that activates when a specific condition occurs. The illusion is imperceptible until then. It must be no larger than a 30’ cube, how the illusion behaves and what sounds it makes is decided at casting. This scripted performance can last up to 5 minutes. When the condition specified occurs, the illusion springs into existence and performs in the manner described. Once the illusion finishes performing, it disappears and remains dormant for 10 minutes. After this time, the illusion can be activated again. The triggering condition can be general or detailed, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30’ of the area. For example, an illusion of this Caster could appear and warn off others who attempt to open a trapped door, or the illusion could trigger only when a Creature says the correct word or phrase. Illusions fail physical inspection, an action to successfully inspect with an INT (Investigation) reveals them, becoming semi-transparent and other sensations transitory', entry:'spell 3(6) 5e (illusion)' },

Each panel of 10 × 10’ has DEF +5 and 30 HP, and is vulnerable to fire. Reducing a panel to 0 HP destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse. Creatures passing through the frigid air left behind by a destroyed panel make a CON save or take 5d6 (save ½) cold damage.

The material body left behind is unconscious and in a state of suspended animation and doesn’t need food or air and will not age.

    { name:'wish', desc:'Wish is the mightiest spell a mortal Creature can cast. By simply speaking aloud, alter the very foundations of reality in accord with this Caster’s desires. The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens this Caster. After enduring that stress, each time casting a spell until finish a long rest, this Caster takes 1d10 necrotic damage per SpellLvl. This damage cannot be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, their STR drops to -3 for 2d4 days. For each of those days spent resting and doing nothing more than light activity, remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33% chance that the Caster is unable to cast wish ever again. The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of SpellLvl 4 or lower. Any requirements in that spell, including costly components, do not need to be met. The spell simply takes effect. Alternatively, produce one of the following effects - Create one object of up to 25000 GP in value that isn’t a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 unit in any dimension, and appears in a seen unoccupied space on the ground; Allow up to twenty seen Creatures to regain all HP, and end all effects on them described in the greater restoration spell; Grant up to ten seen Creatures resistance to a damage type; Grant up to ten seen Creatures immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours; Undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result; Achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State the wish to the GM as precisely as possible. The GM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance... the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect desired might only be partly achieved, or this Caster might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how the wish was worded', entry:'spell 4(9) 5e (conjuration)' },

    { name:'Common', desc:'Common, Commonspeech or Common Tongue is the trade language, lingua franca, bridge language, auxiliary language, vehicular language, or link language of the world. Dialects vary from region to region, but generally, communication is possible. It may technically be any language, typically the one the Players speak at the table, but could be described as a specific language (For instance a campaign in the upper planes might have celestial as the common tongue, and that would make material plane languages less common). Such languages are systematically used to make communication possible between groups of people who do not share a native language or dialect, particularly when involving a third language that is distinct from the speakers’ native languages. Usage: Material Plane. Literacy: Commonplace. Script: Common', entry:'Languages (common)' },
    { name:'Abyssal', desc:'The common language of demons, sounding gutteral and often including harsh consonants and sounds. A form of the Primordial language warped and twisted by the evil of the Abyss, demons are born into existence knowing how to speak or at least understand it. Lower-ranking demons speak using sounds like the barking of canines, while the speech of more refined demons sounded like softly droning ocean waves mingled with the violence of a swarm of angry hornets. As with everything involving the tanar’ri, however, their speech was unpredictable, and sometimes an elite Balor’s words were rougher or a lowly Barlgura’s words smoother. Most demons are not in a rush to talk, and so in the lower planes it’s only the second most used language.  Usage: Lower Planes(Abyss). Literacy: Rare. Script: Infernal', entry:'Languages (common)' },
    { name:'Celestial', desc:'The language of celestials, the common language of the upper planes. Described as beautiful and melodic, yet alien in nature, since it was developed among beings with thought patterns very different to those of mortals. Its organic lettering and flourishes makes the script as beautiful as the spoken word. Clerics often take the time to learn it, and the Celestial lettering is sometimes used to transcribe other languages, especially of the old empires. Usage: Upper Planes. Literacy: Moderate. Script: Celestial', entry:'Languages (common)' },
    { name:'Deep Speech', desc:'The language of most aberrations, an alien form of communication originating in the Far Realm. It has no native script of its own, but when written by mortals it used the alphabet of the moon elves, as it was first transcribed by the drow due to frequent contact between the two groups living in relatively close proximity within the Underdark. Often detectable as a series of bizarre sounds or throaty and incomprehensible utterances. Usage: Far Realm, Underdark. Literacy: Very Rare. Script: None', entry:'Languages (common)' },
    { name:'Draconic', desc:'One of the earliest languages, Draconic influenced many later languages. Native speakers included kobolds, dragonborn, lizardfolk, and troglodytes. Dragons call their language “Glav” and use a unique draconic alphabet and script. Serving as the primary arcane notation in magic, it is believed to be the oldest mortal tongue. Some scholars suggest it was created by an unknown ancestor species of true dragons. Draconic has remained largely unchanged, with “Aragrakh” as the sole known ancient variant. Minor dialect variations existed among different dragon types, akin to regional accents. Metallic dragons had consistent accents, and the dragons of Abeir used “Aklave”, similar to the material plane’s dialect. Dragonborn and kobolds had their own dialects, “Tymantheran" and “Yipyak”, respectively. Characterized by harsh consonants and sibilants, often resembling hissing (e.g., sj, ss, sv), and includes a throat-clearing sound (ach). Emphasis is placed on the first syllable, and important ideas are stressed at word beginnings and ends. Modifying words are positioned before or after the modified word, with the most significant modifier placed first, often repeated afterward for emphasis. Instead of “my” or “mine”, Draconic uses various prefixes based on meaning. Usage: Cosmic. Literacy: Moderate. Script: Draconic', entry:'Languages (common)' },
    { name:'Dwarvish', desc:'The language of dwarves, known as Dethek among themselves, is widespread (though most others used Dethek to refer to the blocky, architectural, runic alphabet in which the language was written, making it easier to engrave or carve into stones). Over time, isolated dwarf communities developed their own unique dialects, including Kurit, Riftspeak, Duergan, Shanatan, Galenan, and Authalan, which were used by various dwarf subgroups like artic dwarves, gold dwarves, shield dwarves, western shield dwarves, eastern shield dwarves, and wild dwarves, respectively. Dwarvish shared many grammatical constructs with Common. This was likely because both languages evolved alongside each other, making it relatively easy for Common speakers to learn and translate Dwarvish. The language had a gruff and robust quality, often associated with the deep and resonant voices of dwarves. It has a harsh and consonant-heavy sound, reflecting the hardy and earthy nature of the dwarven people. Usage: Material Plane. Literacy: Commonplace. Script: Dethek', entry:'Languages (common)' },
    { name:'Elvish', desc:'Elven, also known as Elvish, is the language of the Elves, described as the True Tongue by them, the Tel’Quessir (eladrin, elves, and drow, etc). Believed to be descended from Sylvan, it is written in Espruar, the script of moon elves. Occasionally, the Hamarfae script, designed for Seldruin, serves as an uncommon alternative. Seldruin, steeped in Elven High Magic, is also sometimes used for written communication in rare instances. Regardless of the lettering, the melodic sing-songy language is easily understood by all Elves. One distinct Elven dialect, Wild Elvish, is spoken by Sylvan elves. Its highly musical quality, though enchanting, may seem exotic and perplexing to other elven peoples. Understanding it requires extra effort and patience due to its unique tonal nuances and rhythms, distinct from conventional Elvish dialects. Wild Elvish has even more harmonious melodies, reminiscent of the intricate tunes of an otherworldly forest. Its ethereal charm presents a unique linguistic challenge to non-sylvan elves. Usage: Material Plane. Literacy: Commonplace. Script: Espruar', entry:'Languages (common)' },
    { name:'Gnomish', desc:'The language of gnomes, also known as Gnim. With a simple structure and fluid tones, most gnomes have a truly daunting vocabulary. The language has an extremely fine degree of distinction. For example, kinds of love or shades of green number in the dozens if not hundreds. With a whimsical and playful quality it has a lot of consonant clusters and cheerful sounds. Gnomish words and phrases often reflect the curiosity, inventiveness, and humor of gnomes. Their language is ideal for academic, artistic, and engineering pursuits where precision is important but creativity is equally weighted, and it is widely used in academic circles even among other peoples. Many sages of many peoples consider Gnim to be a “scholar’s language” and many books are written in it. Gnim utilized an adapted version of the Dethek alphabet, that combines runes into more compact forms. Gnomish writings and literature cover a staggering variety of topics due to this lingustic density. Usage: Material Plane. Literacy: Moderate. Script: Modified Dethek', entry:'Languages (common)' },
    { name:'Halfling', desc:'The halfling language, properly called Luiric (or Lurienal). Since halflings are so adaptive by nature, the vast majority of halflings outside of their lands abandon their native tongue and speak Common or other languages instead. Example words of halfling include, bouqtha “good food” (from the fruity pastry boughti), “halfole” an underground dwelling in Luiren, often belonging to rich “hin” (people), “inil” light, “pennig” pony, “shyr” river, “vellam” money. Usage: Material Plane. Literacy: Moderate. Script: Common', entry:'Languages (common)' },
    { name:'Infernal', desc:'Infernal is the language of devils, and of the Nine Hells. It’s commonly used in the lower planes and was brought to the material world through contact with evil beings. Described as harsh and alien due to its origin among beings with vastly different thought patterns from mortals, clerics often learn it, and it was used for transcribing some old Empire dialects. Besides communication between the denizens of lower planes, it was also employed for infernal contracts with a unique Infernal Script. Closely tied to the Nine Hells’ caste system, it is divided into four parts. Though each part used the same basic foundation, each expressed different concepts and used different words. The least form was simple and harsh, suitable for battlefield commands. The lesser form was less gravelly but not musical like mortal languages, expressing more complex concepts. The greater form was formal, complex, and required planning and the ability to respond intelligently to phrases based only on the most subtle of cues. It was nearly impossible for mortals to learn. The fourth form was a corrupt and malevolent court language used by high devils, capable of inducing hateful despair in listeners just through hearing its patterns Usage: Lower Planes. Literacy: Commonplace. Script: Infernal', entry:'Languages (common)' },
    { name:'Primordial', desc:'Primordial is the language of primordials and elementals, with many Giants using a debased form of it. Abyssal, associated with the Abyss, is a distorted version of Primordial. It’s considered a language family, grouping elemental languages like Aquan, Auran, Ignan, and Terran as dialects of Primordial. These dialects share enough similarities that understanding one aids comprehension of the others, though careful attention to patterns is needed. Primordial is written in Barazhad or Dwarvish script. Unlike most languages, it conveys meaning through timing and emphasis of sounds. Any sound can be substituted into the pattern, making it comprehensible to other dialects. However, recognizing these timing and emphasis patterns requires a high level of intelligence. Usage: Inner Planes. Literacy: Moderate. Script: Dethek', entry:'Languages (common)' },
    { name:'Undercommon', desc:'Undercommon is the trade language spoken by the majority of intelligent peoples native to the Underdark. Highly inspired by the drow dialect of elvish and deep speech combined, it is written using the Espruar alphabet and a unique notation, and includes many alien sounds. Usage: Underdark. Literacy: Moderate. Script: Elvish', entry:'Languages (common)' },
    { name:'Aquan', desc:'The language of the Elemental Plane of Water, a flowing language full of subtleties of meaning. Described as bubbling, burbling, splishing or splashing, many underwater dwelling peoples can speak it', entry:'Languages (uncommon)' },
    { name:'Auran', desc:'The language of the Elemental Plane of Air, a breathy, relaxed language that has been described as a slow exhaling of air, many sky dwelling or flying peoples can speak it. Kenku tend to understand Auran, but only produce speech through mimicry', entry:'Languages (uncommon)' },
    { name:'Giant', desc:'The languages of Giants, known by them as Jotun, one of the oldest languages still in use. Believed to share some roots with Ancient Common and written in Dethek runes. Ancient giants also used logographic runes for runecasting and symbolic representation in art, depicting cosmic forces and deeper truths. Jotun typically follows a subject–verb–object order but has exceptions. The copula “er” is often omitted, and plural forms of nouns depend on declension as in the examples, the plural of jotun (“giant”) jotunen, and the plural of huslyd (“family”) huslyder. Giant derived from the Primordial language, with strong Old Dwarven influences in Jotunstein. Old Common and Common share possible linguistic roots with Jotun, possibly evolving from an even more ancient giant language. Only about 1% of giants had significant knowledge of ancient giant runes. However, some giants and ancient dragons still used them, especially runecasters. Many dialects based on Jotun have evolved, including Jogishk, Jotunalder, Jotunhaug, Jotunild, Jotunise, Jotunskye, Jotunstein, Jotunuvar. These are spoken among ogres, giantkin, hill, mountain, fire, frost, cloud, fog, stone, and storm giants, respectively', entry:'Languages (uncommon)' },
    { name:'Gith', desc:'The language of all gith, both githyanki and githzerai. Gith had two main dialects and accents, spoken by each respectively. The main writing system of the Gith language was called tir’su. It consisted of arranging each word as a circular pattern, also called a tir’su, with each letter constituting a “spoke” of the wheel. Sentences and phrases were formed by connecting several individual tir’su. The two Gith dialects differed not only in the accent, but also in the usage of the writing system. In the githyanki dialect, each word was written clockwise, starting from the top. The githzerai dialect started each word from the bottom, filling the wheel counter-clockwise. Examples include “chraith” enemy, “gh’ath” ship, “ghaik” mortal enemy, “gish” skilled, “hshar’lak” traitor, “istik” outsider, “vin’isk” subordinate, “crèche” hatchery, “tchk” an exclamation used to express a range of emotions including surprise, anger, disappointment, annoyance', entry:'Languages (uncommon)' },
    { name:'Gnoll', desc:'As a language, gnoll is not a complete one, only able to communicate basic concepts. It consists of cackling, howling, and whining sounds and often relies on gestures and facial expressions. Such words get mixed with a broken version of the Abyssal language, allowing the leaders among them to communicate more complex thoughts. Uncommonly it is spoken as a second language by bugbears, elves, goblins, lizardfolk, or orcs. Gnoll has no true script or written form, but some gnolls are shrewd enough to write in Abyssal', entry:'Languages (uncommon)' },
    { name:'Goblin', desc:'The language spoken by goblins, also known as Ghukliak, is a guttural one with much grunting and whimpering noises. It might be written in Dethek, or more commonly in the modern age, the Old Common alphabet instead. Examples include “booyahg” magic, “hruggekolohk” bugbear god Hruggek’s place, “gever vaza” we’re having meat tonight, “kherek-nor” attack, “nying” gift, “vaws-hak” death, “vek” hurray', entry:'Languages (uncommon)' },

    { name:'Merfolk', desc:'The language of the Merfolk, Merr, a graceful language rivaling that of surface elves and aquatic elves alike. Written using common script, and often incorporating aquan sounds with many loanwords, it is influenced by aquan, common, locathah, shalarin, kuo-toan, sahuagin, and aquatic elvish. Like the pidgin language Serusan, Merr contains dolphin clicks and whistles', entry:'Languages (uncommon)' },
    { name:'Minotaur', desc:'The language of Minotaurs, containing a number of vocalizations only known and comprehendible by their own kin, reminiscent of grunts and sounds emitted by mundane cattle bulls. Minotaur language shares similarities to the Ogre language, allowing those who were proficient in one tongue quickly pick up the intricacies of the other. Unlike Ogre, Minotaurs create complex concepts through compound words made of other words, and can speak an entire sentence-worth of ideas with single word of sufficient length', entry:'Languages (uncommon)' },
    { name:'Orc', desc:'The language of the orc, known as orcish or daraktan, is both written and spoken. The Dethek script is most commonly used for written Orcish, evolving from the archaic Hulgorkyn language. Examples include “anukh” attack, “arumwon” beast brother (animal companions), “dglinkarz” insulting of dwarves, “dukhal” bastard, “duluk” beware, “durgreos” greetings (no fight), “gubuk” soft skins (derogatory of non-orcs), “malwun” oathbrother, “mal karash” oathbreaker, “terruk-ukl” giant spider, “ukrypt” home, “ukul” spider', entry:'Languages (uncommon)' },
    { name:'Sylvan', desc:'The language of the fae creatures from the Plane of Faerie is often viewed as the language of nature, given that its speakers are frequently nature spirits and wild beings. Despite being one of the oldest known languages, rivaling even Primordial, it remains relatively obscure. It serves as the precursor to all Elvish tongues and is even more melodious and song-like in its structure. This enchanting language can be written in either Espruar or Elvish scripts', entry:'Languages (uncommon)' },
    { name:'Sahuagin', desc:'The language used by sahuagin to speak among themselves, it is rarely spoken outside of aquatic circles. Hearing it above the water might even make it incomprehensible to anyone who normally understands it. Many aquatic peoples learn this language to speak with the dangerous sahuagin, to try to avoid conflict and facilitate trade. In the rare instance it is written, the language often utilizes the elven script. Sahuagin claim that the sea elves stole their alphabet for their language but there is no real evidence to substantiate their claim', entry:'Languages (uncommon)' },
    { name:'Terran', desc:'The language of the Elemental Plane of Earth, a rumbling language with deep tones that reverberate through the listener, described as a rockslide, many peoples from the underdark can speak it. The only dialect of primordial spoken by elementals but also written, using the Dethek script', entry:'Languages (uncommon)' },
    { name:'Thri-kreen', desc:'The language of the Thri-kreen is made up of whistles and clicks and snaps of their mandibles. This makes it hard to learn, if a speaker does not share similar mouth-parts. Examples of typical thri-kreen names are Chak-tha, Chit’al, Drik-chkit, Gulnik, Kacht-ta, Kat’chka, Kiktul, Klaktuk, Krik, Pak’cha, Pik-ik-cha, Pok, Ptekwe, Tak-tha, Tal’tich, Tilnak, and Tik-tik. They had no gendered names and no surnames. Thri-kreen whose packs ranged close to civilizations often picked up a little of the local languages too, usually Common, but Elven, Giant, Gnoll, Goblin, and Halfling were all possible', entry:'Languages (uncommon)' },
    { name:'Thieves’ Cant', desc:'The covert language spoken and signed by rogues, deceitful priests, and criminals in the underground culture of the overworld, thieves’ cant, or simply “cant” employs a distinct grammar, incorporating local dialects, coded language, idioms, and hand gestures, often spoken within the context of comprehensible languages. To eavesdroppers, it may sound like a regular conversation, only revealing its encoded nature upon closer examination. While thieves’ cant allows rogues and thieves to communicate secretly, it cannot exist independently of other languages. When two speakers share no common tongue, vague concepts can be conveyed through gestures. Using a rigid word order – time, verb, subject, place, indirect object, direct object – discussions and plans can unfold. Adjectives are omitted, and a unique form of pluralization and adjective magnitude, along with specific rules for verb tense, are employed to create the code. Some variations of thieves’ cant incorporate animal noises. It’s rarely written down, as speakers are expected to leave no trace of the communication ever occurring. Despite this restriction, cant symbols do exist to convey the same vague concepts as hand signs', entry:'Languages (uncommon)' },
    { name:'Druidic', desc:'The secret language of druids, Druidic is forbidden to be taught to anyone who was not a druid. Making use of its own alphabetic script, it is actually a language subgroup composed of two distinct but similar languages. The vast majority of druids spoke Drueidan, those from the Moonshae Isles spoke a language called Daelic. Drueidan was developed by a powerful group of druids who worshiped Silvanus. Silvanus made an agreement with the other nature gods of the pantheon to allow druids all over to speak it. Daelic, on the other hand, was developed by druids who worshiped the Earthmother', entry:'Languages (uncommon)' },
    { name:'Sign', desc:'A non-verbal language, sign language uses handshape, palm orientation, movement, location, and expression/non-manual signals. Not to be confused with the limited gestural language in Thieves’ Cant, sign language was originally created by devout monks that wished to communicate without violating their vow of silence. Eventually the language spread as a way to communicate without speaking, being adopted by communities of mute and deaf peoples, as well as martial classes for directions on the battlefield. It has gestural letters, numbers, words, and grammar, like any other complete language', entry:'Languages (uncommon)' },
    { name:'Arcane', desc:'The language of mages, the arcane language is only understood by high level magic users. It utilizes the Draconic script most often, but the concepts conveyed only make sense when one has a robust understanding of the magical underpinnings of reality. Knowing draconic will rarely reveal the meaning of Arcane writings. Sacred geometries, mathematical formulae, esoterica and alchemical symbols are all common elements of the language, and it is less about obscuring the contents of the information and more about the high level of specificity and jargon of magic use that leads to it being complex and incomprehensible by the novice reader or listener', entry:'Languages (rare)' },
