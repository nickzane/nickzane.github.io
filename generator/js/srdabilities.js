    { name:'hold monster', desc:'For 1 minute’s focus, a seen Creature within 90’ makes a WIS save or is paralyzed unless it is undead. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another WIS save. On a success, the spell ends on the target', entry:'spell 2(5) 5e' },
    { name:'insect plague', desc:'For up to 10 minute’s focus, swarming, biting locusts fill a 20’ radius sphere centered on a seen point within 300’.

    { name:'legend lore', desc:'For 1 minute of casting and while possessing 4 ivory strips worth at least 50 GP each and for incense worth at least 250 GP (450 GP total), a named or described person, place, or object brings to mind a brief summary of the significant lore about the thing named. The lore might consist of current tales, forgotten stories, or even secret lore that has never been widely known. If the thing named is not of legendary importance, no information is gained. The more information already possessed about the thing, the more precise and detailed the information received is. The information learned is accurate but might be couched in figurative language. For example, if a mysterious magic axe is on hand, the spell might yield this information - "Woe to the evildoer whose hand touches the axe, for even the haft slices the hand of the evil ones. Only a true Child of Stone, lover and beloved of Moradin, may awaken the true powers of the axe, and only with the sacred word Rudnogg on the lips"', entry:'spell 2(5) 5e' },

    { name:'mislead', desc:'For up to 1 hour’s focus, become invisible at the same time as an illusory double appears where this Caster stood. The double lasts for the duration, but the invisibility ends when attacking or casting a spell. Use an action to move the illusory double up to twice walking speed and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way chosen. This Caster may see through the double’s eyes and hear through its ears as if they were located where ever it is, by switching senses or switching back again as a bonus action. While using its senses, become blinded and deafened to the senses of the Caster', entry:'spell 2(5) 5e' },
    { name:'modify memory', desc:'For 1 minute’s focus, attempt to reshape another Creature’s memories. One seen Creature makes a WIS save or becomes charmed. If fighting the Creature, it has advantage on the save. The charmed target is incapacitated and unaware of its surroundings, though it can still hear. If it takes any damage or is targeted by another spell, this spell ends, and none of the target’s memories are modified. Affect the target’s memory of an event that it experienced within the last 24 hours and that lasted no more than 10 minutes. Permanently eliminate all memory of the event, allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity and exacting detail, change its memory of the details of the event, or create a memory of some other event. If it is able to understand this Caster’s language, speak to the target to describe how its memories are affected for the modified memories to take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of the description. If the spell ends before finishing the described modified memories, the Creature’s memory are not altered. Otherwise, the modified memories take hold when the spell ends. A modified memory does not necessarily affect how a Creature behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the Creature’s natural inclinations, alignment, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such as implanting a memory of how much the Creature enjoyed dousing itself in acid, is dismissed, perhaps as a bad dream. The GM might deem a modified memory too nonsensical to affect a Creature in a significant manner. A remove curse or greater restoration spell cast on the target restores the Creature’s true memory', entry:'spell 2(5) 5e' },

    { name:'planar binding', desc:'For 1 hour of casting and a jewel worth at least 1000 GP, attempt to bind a celestial, elemental, fae, or a fiend within 60’ to this Caster’s service. The Creature must be within that range for the entire casting of the spell (a magic circle can keep it trapped while this spell is cast). At the completion of the casting, the target makes a CHA save or is bound to serve this Caster for a day. If the Creature was summoned or created by another spell, that spell’s duration is extended to match the duration of this spell. A bound Creature must follow instructions to the best of its ability. For example, command the Creature to accompany them on an adventure, to guard a location, or to deliver a message. The Creature obeys the letter of instructions, but if the Creature is hostile, it strives to twist the words to achieve its own objectives. If the Creature carries out the instructions completely before the spell ends, it travels to back to report this fact to the Caster if it is on the same plane of existence. If on a different plane of existence, it returns to the place where it was bound and remains there until the spell ends', entry:'spell 2(5) 5e' },

This spell also neutralizes any poisons and cures nonmagical diseases that affected the Creature at the time it died. This spell does not remove magical diseases, curses, or similar effects if these aren’t first removed prior to casting the spell. The spell cannot return an undead Creature to life. This spell closes all mortal wounds except missing body parts. If the Creature is lacking body parts or organs integral for its survival the spell automatically fails. Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a −4 penalty to all attack rolls, saves, and ability rolls. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears', entry:'spell 2(5) 5e' },

Provided that the Creature has been dead no longer than 10 days, the spell forms a new adult body for it and then calls the soul to enter that body, if the target’s soul is free or willing to do so, otherwise the spell fails. The magic fashions a new body for the Creature to inhabit, which likely causes the Creature’s kind to change. The form the Creature takes when restored to life is determined by a table below, or the GM chooses a form. The reincarnated Creature recalls its former life and experiences. It retains the capabilities it had in its original form, except it exchanges its original kind for the new one and changes its traits accordingly.

The target makes a WIS save against a TN modified by how well the target is known and the sort of physical connection the Caster has with it. If a target knows this spell is being cast, it can fail the save voluntarily if it wants to be observed. If the Caster has only heard of the target the target’s save MOD is +5, has met the target +0, knows the target well -5. If the Caster’s connection to the target is a picture or likeness the target’s save MOD is -2, a possession or garment -4, body part, lock of hair, bit of nail or the like -10. On a successful save, the target isn’t affected, and this spell cannot be used against it again for a day. On a failed save, the spell creates an invisible sensor within 10’ of the target. See and hear through the sensor as if there. The sensor moves with the target, remaining within 10’ for the duration. A Creature that can see invisible objects sees the sensor as a luminous orb about the size of a fist.

The target may repeat the STR roll on this Caster’s subsequent turns to break the hold [Object] An unsecured object weighing 1000 lbs or less is moved 30’, even into the air. If attended, a contest against that Creature’s STR contested by the Caster’s Casting MOD determines if it is pulled away and moved. Affect the same target round after round, or choose a new one at any time. If switching targets, the prior target is no longer affected by the spell.

Any Creature that enters the portal instantly appears within 5’ of the destination circle or in the nearest unoccupied space. Many major temples, guilds, and other important places have permanent teleportation circles inscribed somewhere within their confines. Each such circle includes a unique sigil sequence, a string of magical runes arranged in a particular pattern. When first gaining the ability to cast this spell, learn the sigil sequences for 2 destinations on the Current or Material Plane (determined by the GM).

If the wall cuts through a Creature’s space when it appears, the Creature is pushed to one side of the wall (Caster’s choice which side). If a Creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that Creature makes a DEX save to use its reaction to move its speed out of the enclosed space or become surrounded. The wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel of 10×10’ has DEF +5 and 30 HP. Reducing a panel to 0 HP destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse.

Creatures protected by spells like protection from evil and good or magic circle cannot be possessed, but the Caster can make an attempt to possess any seen Creature within the specified range. The target makes a CHA save, or the Caster’s soul will transfer into the target body while the target’s soul becomes trapped in the container. Otherwise, efforts to possess the target fail, and so do attempts to possess it again for 1 day. Once the Caster possesses a Creature’s body, they gain full control over it, replacing the Creature’s statistics with their own alignment, INT, WIS, CHA, and type related features. Meanwhile, the possessed Creature’s soul can perceive the world from the container, using its own senses, but it remains immobile and unable to take any actions. To return from the host body to the container, the Caster must use an action. If the host body dies while the Caster’s soul is inside it, the Caster makes a CHA save against their own spell save TN. Success allows them to return to the container, failure results in the Caster’s death. If the container is destroyed or the spell’s duration ends, the possessing soul immediately returns to its original body, and any soul inside the container returns to its own body. When attempting to return, if one or more of the bodies are deceased, possessed by another soul, or more than 100’ away from the container, it leads to the death of one or both individuals, depending on the availability of a suitable body. When the spell ends, the container destroys itself', entry:'spell 3(6) 5e' },
    { name:'mass suggestion', desc:'Magically influence up to 12 seen Creatures within 60’ that can hear and understand the Caster, for 1 unfocused day, with a few spoken sentences. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the Creature to harm, or do some other obviously directly damaging act, or harm itself, automatically negates the effect of the spell. Each target makes a WIS save or it pursues the course of action described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do. Specify conditions that will trigger any special activity during the duration. For example, the suggestion might be that a group of soldiers give all their money to the first beggar they meet. If the condition is not met before the spell ends, the activity is not performed. If the caster or any of their companions damage a Creature affected by this spell, the spell ends for that Creature', entry:'spell 3(6) 5e' },
    { name:'move earth', desc:'For up to 2 hours focus, an area of seen terrain within 120’ no larger than 40’ on a side is reshaped, and any dirt, sand, or clay in the area takes any form this Caster chooses. Raise or lower the elevation, create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The extent of any such changes cannot exceed half the area’s largest dimension. So, if affecting a 40’ square, create a pillar up to 20’ high, raise or lower the elevation by up to 20’, dig a trench up to 20’ deep, and so on. It takes 10 minutes for these changes to complete. At the end of every 10 minute’s focus spent on the spell, this Caster can choose a new area of terrain to affect. Because the terrain transformation occurs slowly, Creatures in the area cannot usually be trapped or injured by the movement. This spell cannot manipulate natural stone or stone construction. Rocks and structures shift to accommodate the new terrain. However, if the way the terrain is shaped would make a structure unstable, it may collapse. Similarly, this spell does not directly affect plant growth. The moved earth carries any plants along with it', entry:'spell 3(6) 5e' },
    { name:'planar ally', desc:'For 10 minutes of casting, beseech an otherworldly entity for aid. The being must be known to this Caster: a god, a primordial, a demon prince, or some other being of cosmic power. That entity sends a celestial, an elemental, or a fiend loyal to it to aid, making the Creature appear in an unoccupied space within 60’. A specific Creature’s name spoken when casting this spell may request that Creature, though a different Creature may appear anyway (GM’s choice). When the Creature appears, it is under no compulsion to behave in any particular way. Ask the Creature to perform a service in exchange for payment, but it is not obliged to do so. The requested task could range from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help us fight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemies, or protect us during our foray into the dungeon). Ability to communicate with the Creature is necessary to bargain for its services. Payment can take a variety of forms. A celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some Creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by this Party. As a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth 100 GP per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1000 GP per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10000 GP per day. These payments are based on the circumstances under which the spell is cast. If the task is aligned with the Creature’s ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal. After the Creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration of service expires, the Creature returns to its home plane after reporting back, if possible and appropriate to the task. A party unable to agree on a price for the Creature’s service causes the Creature to immediately return to its home plane. A Creature enlisted to join a group counts as a member of it, receiving a full share of experience points awarded', entry:'spell 3(6) 5e' },
    { name:'programmed illusion', desc:'While possessing a bit of fleece and jade dust worth at least 25 GP, create an illusion of an object, a Creature, or some other visible phenomenon, at a seen point within 120’, that activates when a specific condition occurs. The illusion is imperceptible until then. It must be no larger than a 30’ cube, how the illusion behaves and what sounds it makes is decided at casting. This scripted performance can last up to 5 minutes. When the condition specified occurs, the illusion springs into existence and performs in the manner described. Once the illusion finishes performing, it disappears and remains dormant for 10 minutes. After this time, the illusion can be activated again. The triggering condition can be general or detailed, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30’ of the area. For example, an illusion of this Caster could appear and warn off others who attempt to open a trapped door, or the illusion could trigger only when a Creature says the correct word or phrase. Illusions fail physical inspection, an action to successfully inspect with an INT (Investigation) reveals them, making it semi-transparent and other sensations transitory', entry:'spell 3(6) 5e' },
    { name:'sunbeam', desc:'For 1 minute’s focus, a mote of brilliant radiant sunlight shines in this Caster’s hand. A beam of luminosity flashes out from it in a 5’ wide, 60’ long line. Each Creature in the line makes a CON save or takes 6d8 radiant damage and is blinded until next turn. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this save. Create a new line of radiance as an action on any turn until the spell ends. It sheds bright light in a close-by radius and dim light far away', entry:'spell 3(6) 5e' },

    { name:'conjure celestial', desc:'For 1 minute of casting, lasting up to 1 hour’s focus, summon a celestial Creature with four hearts or lower that appears at a seen unoccupied space within 90’. It allies itself to this Caster and their companions, follows general commands that don’t violate its alignment, but if none are given, defends itself against hostiles. If focus is broken, the Creature disappears', entry:'spell 3(7) 5e' },

    { name:'teleport', desc:'Instantly transport this Caster and up to 8 willing seen Creatures within 5’, or a single seen in-reach Huge or smaller object not held or carried by an unwilling Creature, to a selected destination. The chosen destination must be known to this Caster, and it must be on the same plane of existence. Familiarity with the destination determines whether travellers arrive there successfully. An established teleportation circle whose sigil sequence is known or while possessing an object taken from the desired destination within the last 6 months permits the teleport to occur without issue, otherwise roll 1d100 - [Very Familiar locations] 0-5 mishap, 6-13 teleports to a similar area, 14-24 lands off target, and 25-100 is on target [Casually Seen locations] 0-33 mishap, 34-43 teleports to a similar area, 44-53 lands off target, and 54-100 is on target [Locations Viewed Once] mishap at 0-43, teleport to a similar area at 44-53, land off target at 54-73, and are on target at 74-100. [False Destination location (a place that doesn’t exist)] mishap 0-50, and teleporting to a similar area happens on a roll of 51-100. Off target travellers appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction (1d10×1d10% of the distance traveled). Roll 1d8 - 1) north 2) northeast 3) east 4) southeast 5) south 6) southwest 7) west 8) northwest. A Similar Area is a different area that is visually or thematically similar to the target area, generally appearing in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, conceivably travellers could wind up anywhere on the plane. Mishap means the spell’s potent but dangerous magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting Creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the GM rerolls on the table to see where the travellers wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time)', entry:'spell 3(7) 5e' },
