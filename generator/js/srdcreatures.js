An average lamia had a leonine body, vicious black claws and a hunger for torture and Bipedal flesh. Lamias adorn their crumbling havens with stolen finery, using illusory magic to further accentuate them. Breathtaking gardens, finely decorated dwellings with numerous servants, seem at odds to the remoteness and state of ruin in the desert. Those it beguiles with seduction or spells are pitted against each other in elaborate contests. Using a pool of water or a mirror in conjunction with a scrying spell, they survey over trade routes and nearby settlements, or to seek out objects and creatures, particularly adventurers with pure hearts to seduce and corrupt to evil. To lure potential victims to their domain they rely on illusion and their thralls to capture hapless foes. Lamias prize beauty and strength above all else, prisoners that falls short of their esteem becomes the main course in a horrible feast, or are set free to die wandering the wastes. As long as they have servants to face their enemies, lamias fight from the fringes, beguiling foes with magic if they can. A lamia pressed into melee never stays there for long, shredding flesh with claw and dagger before springing away to safety [Multiattack] The lamia makes 2 attacks - 1 with its claws and 1 with its dagger or Intoxicating Touch [Claws] Melee Weapon.
