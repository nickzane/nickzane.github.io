    {name:'Universal RPGs', desc:'The ultimate goal in RPGs (Role-playing Games) is to construct a narrative, making it a collaborative effort among all players. All RPGs share 3 essential elements - 1) Characters with growing abilities, 2) a set of rules to guide gameplay, 3) players who take on these roles. Each player becomes at least 1 Character (typically a protagonist that shapes the story) following mechanics (game rules) often guided by at least one second kind of player called a “Game Master”, “Story Leader”, or “Dungeon Master” who ensures rule adherence and narrative coherence, often also playing the world and its non-player Characters. Characters evolve from humble beginnings to greater significance, journeying through worlds where their choices carry weight, propelling the storyline forward. Non-Player Characters come and go as allies or foes, bringing the game world to life. When the game concludes, players have not only experienced a story (possibly as vivid as their own lives, if their imagination is capable) but also forged lasting memories. The most exceptional games build a communal reality among players, fostering a sense of camaraderie and cherished adventures and personalities', entry:'Game Rule (Universal)' },
    { name:'GMs and Players', desc:'The Game Master (GM) is responsible for introducing scenes, managing non-player Characters, revealing challenges, and offering incentives for Character engagement (Loot, Adventure, and consequential choices to be made). The GM sets the stage, maintains the game’s flow, interprets dice results, and resolves disputes arising from conflicting ideas. Ensuring everyone has an enjoyable experience is their paramount responsibility. Players, like the GM, aim for fairness and fun. Ideally a player understands all their character’s abilities as described on the sheet, and the ad-hoc improvizational system for doing anything not described there. They define their Character’s abilities through their imagination and their Character sheets, using either to describe their attempted actions. Players can also ask the GM clarifying questions about the scene to better inform their choices. The GM may announces relevant contests, and once players agree, the tests are executed, shaping the story. A back-and-forth between all players including the GM is all a player needs to understand to start playing. Using Session Zero to establish these rules and learn your Character sheet is the only preparation needed to play', entry:'Game Rule (Universal)' },
    { name:'The Terms', desc:'Game Masters (GM) run the game, are the setting/world, and arbitrate disputes. Player Characters (PC) move the plot, are the main actors, and are played by players roleplaying Characters. Non-player Characters (NPC) are all the other characters in the story, usually played by the GM but sometimes played by players. Target Number (TN) is the number to meet or beat with a roll of the dice, to determine success or failure. Hit Points (HP) are the number of points that keep the player standing and in the game', entry:'Game Rule (General)' },
    { name:'The Basics', desc:'The GM sets the scene, the PCs respond to it with questions, attempts, and effort. The GM knows the game, and tells the players any necessary rolls to determine their success or failure. If no rolls are required, the players simply do what they want. Any disputes are determined by the rules of resolution (Resolving Disputes). The basics - Players say what they want to do, GMs say what needs to happen to succeed, that test is done, the result is described by either GMs, Players, or Both', entry:'Game Rule (General)' },
    { name:'The Parts', desc:'The parts of any role playing game are usually described as the three pillars of gameplay - Exploration, Roleplay, and Combat. Exploration is the world creation portion. GMs may have a game world they are running from a module, one they created themselves, or one they make up on the fly. Players explore by interacting with the world, and the GM describes the results. Roleplaying is the charactization portion. Players may have a backstory they define before play, a character sheet created by the GM, or they might make it up on the fly. Players are meant to exist in the role of their Character and respond to the world in kind. Combat is the conflict portion. This has the most rules and is elaborated elsewhere. The result of combat is either defeat of the enemy, as they are slain or flee, or the defeat of the party by the same terms. Alternatively, combat might end in a draw if everyone ceases fighting, or avoided entirely through clever roleplaying or exploration', entry:'Game Rule (General)' },
    { name:'Resolving Disputes', desc:'Who decides what happens in the collective story of a Roleplaying Game? The answer is an ascending heirarchy of things. The first decision comes from the PCs, as they decide where to go, what to do, how they want to attempt to do it. The second decision comes from the GM (and might supercede the PCs) where they apply the rules and their judgement to determine what tests if any are required. These tests are described elsewhere (Attempts and Contests). The third decision comes from the dice (which might supercede what either the PCs or GM wants). The final decision comes from the entire table. If the majority thinks the story should go another way, they might ask for a dice roll to superecede the GM', entry:'Game Rule (General)' },
    { name:'Time to Die!', desc:'What is with these dice? Well, a die is a random number generator. In real life, these dice come with multiple faces that have a roughly equal chance of landing with a number displayed. A coin has 2 sides. Other dice are described by their faces in the format of how many dice and their faces, I.E. 1d4 is one dice with four faces. The chances of any face on a 4-sided die are 1 in four. The typical attempt dice in this game and many others is a 20-sided die, meaning a 1 in 20 chance of any face, and a 5% chance of a maximum or minimum roll which are described as a natural 20 or critical failure in this system. The dice add the capriciousness of life, you never know for sure what might happen, so you roll the dice and find out', entry:'Game Rule (General)' },
    { name:'Session Zero', desc:'A successful “Session Zero” is pivotal to the quality of an RPG session. During this initial meeting, the players (including the Game Master (GM)) come together to establish the foundation of the game. This includes setting the tone, expectations, and personal boundaries for the upcoming adventures. Players often create their Characters during this session, collaborating with the GM to weave their backgrounds into the campaign’s storyline. It’s an opportunity for open dialogue, where everyone can discuss their preferences, game rules, and any potential concerns, ensuring that the game is enjoyable for all participants. A well-executed Session Zero fosters an environment for the players of honesty and confidence and aligns their creative visions, ensuring a smooth and immersive RPG experience. Key aspects of a fruitful Session Zero include defining the campaign’s themes, deciding on house rules, clarifying Character creation guidelines, and discussing the player-GM dynamics. This initial gathering establishes the narrative’s groundwork and encourages collaboration among participants, ultimately contributing to a cohesive and enjoyable RPG adventure', entry:'Game Rule (General)' },
    { name:'UGRPG', desc:'This game system has Modular Extensibility of Play. That means unlike other systems, it is agnostic on power levels, abilities, and spells. With randomization, anything can happen. Any class from any system can offer their inspiration to this one, and the players choose among them in a buffet-like style. Levels and classes are fuzzy and not rigid. Obvious inspirations include 5e D&D, Pathfinder, and ICRPG. Other inspirations include Dungeon World, Knave, Shadowdark, and many others. This system has this online generator to solve many of the roll tables and dice rolls necessary to play. It generates characters easily, and has GM tools for inspiration including random word generators, and custom item generation. It has an integrated name generator to create character names that combines features from name_generator.js and rinkworks fantasy name generator', entry:'Game Rule (General)' },
    { name:'ICRPG and D&D', desc:'The most obvious inspiration is D&D 5e, simplified play and the classic D&D stats are used. ICRPG contributes hard and easy dice modifiers, a scene target number, and effort dice. Buy these books to get the full information contained in this system. ICRPG Master Edition. All the D&D Books. Any 5e Level UP Book. While this system is inspired by all the TTRPG culture, it deviates slightly in a more robust and outlined magic system, more openness in class and level restrictions, a universalized system for paying costs to do what the players want to do, and lots of variability so the game can be adjusted to the tastes of all sorts of GMs and players', entry:'Game Rule (General)' },
    { name:'Mythic GM', desc:'The Mythic GM System, also known as the Mythic Game Master Emulator, is a versatile tool designed for tabletop role-playing games, enabling solo or cooperative play when a Game Master is not available. It introduces an element of unpredictability by using yes/no questions, tables, and random prompts to emulate the GM’s role. Players can create plot twists, determine outcomes, and generate content based on random results. The system also features a “Chaos Factor” to gauge the level of uncertainty in the narrative, taking into account the odds of success and the Character’s rank in the story. It can be adapted to various RPG systems, making it a valuable resource for dynamic storytelling in the absence of a traditional GM. It can even substitute for the traditional 1d20 system for Character rolls. The Mythic Generator built into the system allows you to ask yes/no questions, select event types, customize odds, and Character abilities, all without a GM or other players. This tool can be used to play an entire game, with or without a GM or other players, as an optional means of storytelling', entry:'Game Rule (General)' },
    { name:'Playable Kinds', desc:'Currently there are 163 Kinds of playable Characters. Normally described as races in other systems, in this system you do not get any inherited traits of the race. Kinds are mostly for flavor, but they do have associated inherited traits which can be purchased through Stat Points or with Hidden Milestones at character creation. A full list can be found elsewhere (Playable Kinds List)', entry:'Game Rule (General)' },
    { name:'Playable Types', desc:'There are only 5 types of playable Characters. Types provide variation in the play styles of Characters. Normally described as classes in other systems, the types in this system are Fighters, Rogues, Zealots, Mages, and Specialists. These can be divided as Martial, Magic Users, or Hybrid Types. Each type has 3 subtypes. Fighters and Rogues are martials and include Monks (Martial Artists), Barbarians, Warriors, Thieves, Assassins, and Spies. Zealots and Mages are magic users and include Clerics, Druids, Paladins, Sorcerers, Warlocks, and Wizards. Specialists are hybrid types and include Artificiers, Rangers, and Bards. Any type can utilize Magic or Martial abilities without “multiclassing”, explained elsewhere (Building a Character)', entry:'Game Rule (General)' },
    { name:'Action Points and Attacking', desc:'In combat there are generally 5 categories of behavior a character can engage in - Interactions, Reactions, Actions, Bonus Actions, or Movement. Tier 1 Characters get 3 action points, renewed at the end of their turn. Each higher tier gets 1 additional action point per tier. Interactions take no time at all, like grabbing something stowed on a belt, or asking a yes/no question of the world. Reactions are actions a player may take outside of their turn, and may be granted by ability or requested by players. Actions are big attempts, which require a substantial amount of their 6 second turn be dedicated to it. Bonus actions are small attempts, and may be granted by ability or requested by players. Movement is the character repositioning themselves on the battlefield. Interactions may cost 1 action point (GM’s discretion). Actions, Bonus actions, Movement, and Reactions cost 1 action point. Spending more than 1 Action Point in the same category results in any tests being done at Disadvantage (Easy/Hard/Advantage/Disadvantage). Spending an additional Action Point can negate this Disadvantage', entry:'Game Rule (General)' },
    { name:'Critical Failure and Critical Success', desc:'In 1d20 Attempts, a 1 is a Critical Failure and a naturally rolled 20 is a Critical Success. Critical Failures may come with additional consequences (GM’s discretion). Critical Successes either roll double, roll ultimate, or explode (GM’s discretion). Exploding dice are rerolled and the subsequent dice is added to the previous result. Exploding dice may continue this way indefinitely.', entry:'Game Rule (General)' },
    { name:'Building a Character', desc:'Character creation begins with a Character’s Tier, signifying their progression in the game. Session Zero is where this was decided. Tier 0 represents a novice adventurer with minimal Hit Points and Stat Points. Tier 1 is the start of a local hero, Tier 2 indicates a transition to a regional hero, Tier 3 is widely known, and Tier 4 is world-famous. Each tier beyond zero requires reaching a minimum of roughly 5-10 milestones, akin to levels in other systems. Next, players choose their Character’s Kind, which define their unique flavor and potential abilities. Examples include deep gnomes, beastfolk, humans, giants, etc. Additionally, players might pick their Character’s size, which impacts their “Starting Stat Number” for Character creation. Sizes are usually tied to their Kind, as some Kinds are larger or smaller than others. However, you might be a smaller or bigger version of your Kind. Lastly, players select the Character’s Type, either Martial (Rogues or Fighters) or Caster (Mages or Zealots) or a combination of classes known as a Specialist. Each has a general subclass, and those may have sub-subclasses described elsewhere (Playable Types or Subtypes Explained). As Characters progress into their adventures, these values may fluctuate widely due to acquired gear, experience points, and available gold pieces, potentially leading to significant changes in a Character’s abilities. All of the preceeding can be generated using the web app with just four dropdowns and a click of a button. Otherwise, the Character’s “Starting Stat Number” depends on the Character’s size, and the Tier Bonus is determined by their tier level. Maximum Stat Points are calculated based on these factors, with any unspent points contributing to possible Hidden Milestones revealed during gameplay. Players can introduce negative quirks as abilities, like “Weak”, “Conspicuous”, or “Slow Healer”, or choose negative base stats to earn additional Stat Points, (known as "Borking" or "Dumping"). Quirks can enhance the flavor of Characterization. Each -1 to a stat below 0 can add 2 AP (max -2). Maximum Effort Stats are determined by adding the Character’s current level to the Starting Stat Number. This math is explained elsewhere (Starting Character Math)', entry:'Game Rule (Character)' },
    { name:'Starting Character Math', desc:'Character creation in this system is versatile and allows Characters to start at any “level”. Levels are categories vaguely defined by their number of Milestones. Stat Points are used to purchase Base and Effort Stats, or optionally to spend 1 Stat Point to acquire an Ability. To determine the Character’s maximum Stat Points, add their Starting Stat Point Number to the number of Milestones. The Starting Number is dictated by the Character’s size, from tiny (+4), small (+6), medium (+8), large (+10), huge (+12). See more about the differences elsewhere (Size Values). The Tier Bonus is dependent on the Character’s Tier, determined generally by their number of Milestones. For instance, Level 0 corresponds to Tier 0, while Tier 1 roughly 1-10 milestones max, roughly 5-15 max for tier 2, roughly 10-20 max for Tier 3, roughly 15-25 max for Tier 4, roughly 20-30 max for Tier 5, and so on. Tiers increase as a Party. A tiny creature of Tier 3, for example, would have a maximum of 20 Stat Points. Any unspent points can be allocated to hidden milestones that will be revealed in play, typically up to a maximum of 5 hidden milestones per Character. Starting effort Stats are determined by the Character’s current Tier added to their Proficiency Roll. As another example if we started our Character in Tier 4 with a Huge creature, that would give us a maximum of 31 Stat points, which we might Stat out as STR 5, DEX 2, CON 5, INT 2, WIS 2, CHA 2, BASIC 2, STANDARD 5, ADVANCED 0, ENHANCED 5, ULTIMATE 1. These Stats are further explained elsewhere (Base Stats and Effort)', entry:'Game Rule (Character)' },
    { name:'Base Stats and Effort', desc:'In this system, a Character can be summarized by two sets of numerical values equalling 12 total numbers. Seven numbers represent the Character’s Base Stats, which serve as modifiers for attempts of various actions. These stats are Strength(STR), Dexterity(DEX), Constitution(CON), Intelligence(INT), Wisdom(WIS), and Charisma(CHA), the final modifier is Defense(DEF), explained elsewhere (Target Numbers and Defense). A modifier of +0 indicates average ability in that aspect, while values exceeding +5 signify exceptional, superhuman levels of ability. When a Character successfully succeeds at an attempted task, they roll an effort die, which can be Basic(BAS) d4, Standard(STA) d6, Enhanced(ENH) d8, Advanced(ADV) d10, Ultimate(ULT) d12, Perfect(PER) d20, or Beyond(BEY) d100, depending on the Character’s attempt, the rules, or GM discretion. Under normal circumstances, only the first 5 modifiers are noteworthy, as the last 2 are reserved for very special situations that almost never have an associated modifier. As an example of how to use effort, a basic action like a punch may yield basic damage, whereas a trained warrior wielding a sword might produce standard damage. Effort is essentially the result of the attempt applied to achieve a successful action, which is subtracted from a total of points if the requirements of the task are beyond pass/fail. As another example, using tools to pick a lock typically involves standard effort, but an expert with sophisticated tools may apply enhanced effort, but a GM may rule lockpicking is either picked or not, and effort rolls will not be necessary as the attempt roll suffices', entry:'Game Rule (Character)' },
    { name:'Stat Points and Character Points', desc:'Stat Points are used to determine numerical values of the modifiers the character adds to their attempt rolls and to buy either 1 ability, mastery, or proficiency. They can be lost or gained through gameplay, or acquired after Milestones. Character points on the other hand represent the extra effort necessary for abilities and spells. Different pools of these points can be acquried through abilities depending on Character Type explained elsewhere (Character Points and their Subtypes). Many types of Character Points are interchangeable, but the basic Character Point value is Hit Points. If you run out of all other Character Points, you can spend Hit Points instead', entry:'Game Rule (Character)' },
    { name:'Character Points and their Subtypes', desc:'Different Types have different pools of Character Points. Fighters have Grit points, which are used to fuel their martial abilities including weapon actions, fighting styles, and battle maneuvers. Rogues have Bit points, which are used to fuel their skill-based abilities including profiencies in single attempts or imposed advantage and disadvantage. Zealots have Zeal points, which reflect their divine or natural favor and are used to fuel their powers, spells and abilities. Mages have different points depending on their subtype. Sorcerers get Sorcery points which can fuel their spells, abilities, or possible metamagic. Warlocks get Pact points which can fuel their spells, abilities, or possible invocations. Wizards get no inherent pool of points, but all Mages can seek out and find sources of Mana Points which can fuel Spells. Subtype points can generally be exchanged as an action for 3 subtype points for 1 HP or 1 HP for 3 subtype points. If a character has multiple subtype pools, they can be exchanged as an action in a 2 to 1 exchange rate', entry:'Game Rule (Character)' },
    { name:'Attempts and Contests', desc:'Generally attempts are determined as successful or not through a predefined method or contest, usually involving a 20-sided die (d20). For instance, the GM might set the scene in a gloomy dungeon hallway, immersing players in its details. An event arises, offering players a chance to make significant choices, creating immediate tension. The player might respond, saying, “I want to handle this situation with a cool and awe-inspiring action”. The GM, sets a target number, instructs the player to roll a d20 (including which proficiency die if relevant), and the player adds applicable modifiers according to terms of the roll, determing success or failure. This process sets the stage for the story’s progression, which might be described by the GM, the player, or both. As many of these interactions occur, a narrative unfolds, filled with heroism, loss, redemption, fear, or whatever the dice inspire. Players steer the story while the GM maintains rule consistency, preventing nonsensical or undesirable outcomes', entry:'Game Rule (Character)' },
    { name:'Target Numbers and Defense', desc:'Target Numbers (TN) determine success or failure in contests. Most of the time, the TN to meet or beat is referred to as the Scene TN, which serves as a universal benchmark for any 1d20 roll. The Scene TN can change based on the ongoing events in the scene. For example, a Scene TN of 10 represents an average level of danger, but if a dragon suddenly appears, the scene becomes more extreme, and the TN may increase to 16 or even higher. In exceptional circumstances or when special NPCs are involved, overriding TNs exist (GM’s discretion), and they should allow the player to know this before they roll any attempts. Players also have TNs specific to their Characters for their spellcasting or martial abilities, which determine what number their adversaries need to beat. TNs are especially significant in combat and defense, representing a Character’s ability to evade or endure area effects, hazards, or targeted attacks. The DEF Stat and its relevance can be optional and its use is determined by the GM. For quicker combat, the TN attempt for combat against enemies might be handled in one of two ways - the PCs will simply roll their effort, a 1 is a miss, and the maximum for that effort dice is a critical hit OR the previous may occur only if the characters attempt MOD plus 10 is greater than the TN, otherwise they must make the attempt to see if they hit (GM’s discretion). For quicker and more intense gameplay, the DEF (Defense) Stat may be ignored or adjusted. It is determined by taking the Character’s CON modifier and adding any relevant ARMOR values. CON is a creature’s natural defense. The bigger the creature, the bigger their CON explained elsewhere (Size Values). DEF might be used passively to see if a roll is required by the enemy. If the modifier plus 10 is greater than the TN, the creature must roll. Alternatively, players roll their DEF on their opponent’s turn, where it serves as either the TN that enemies must overcome, or the Character’s attempt at defense, which must meet or exceed the relevant TN (GM’s discretion). Additionally, DEF may reflect a Character’s ability to absorb damage, acting as a protective layer before HP is reduced by enemies. If DEF is disregarded, factors like Character size and armor become less relevant, making it easier to lose HP but speeding up gameplay', entry:'Game Rule (Character)' },
    { name:'Earning XP and SP', desc:'To acquire XP in the game, players simply need to actively engage with the storyline. Earn 2 points by discovering an Objective and confronting the first related Challenge (GM’s discretion). Completing Objectives thereafter rewards 1 point, successfully resolving Challenges rewards 1 point as well. Challenges represent the core conflicts, threats, dangers, hidden treasures, or macguffins within the plot, where Objectives act as narrative hooks that drive the story forward. For instance, an Objective might be to save the princess, and to save the princess the Characters must rise to the Challenge of defeating the Guards who are keeping her prisoner. That would earn 2 XP. Once a player amasses 10 XP, they gain the ability to acquire a Milestone which grants 1 Stat Point, which effectively advances their Character to a new “level” described as CharLvl in abilities. The max number of XP obtainable at one time is capped at 10. Additionally, players have the option to acquire XP by using in-game currency (GP) at a rate of 1000 GP for 1 XP, up to 3 times per real-life day, per game session, per week', entry:'Game Rule (Character)' },
    { name:'Milestones and Leveling', desc:'This system features a flexible level tracking system where a “level” represents progress in the game. Tiers require a minimum of 5 milestones or “levels” earned to advance, with a total of 5 tiers before a character can climb no higher. Achieving a Milestone grants a Stat Point (SP) with a range of benefits. This SP can be spent on 1 new Proficiency, 1 Heart per Tier, 1 Ability, 1 Chosen Spell, 1 Chosen Loot, +1 Spell Mastery, +1 Skill Mastery, +1 Stat Increase, +1 Effort Increase, or +1 Item Mastery, enhancing the Character’s various abilities. Tracking Tiers, XP, and Natural 20s is how a Character develops. When a Character earns 10 XP and obtains a Milestone within the story, that XP can be spent, marking the final step towards “leveling up”. This is especially important for Character Level (CharLvl)-related spells, abilities, and Tier increases. Milestones are not the exclusive method for acquiring benefits. The same benefits can be purchased with a cumulative total of 20 Natural 20s rolled in a single game session, subtracting any Natural 1s (or relevant dirty 20s if using Dice Modifiers, or Face cards if using a Deck). Additionally, XP can be acquired with in-game currency (GP) at a rate of 1000 GP for 1 XP, up to 3 times per real-life day, per game session, per week. Starting Characters can have up to 5 hidden Milestones, representing undisclosed prerequisite skills from their backstory. These hidden Milestones do not contribute to CharLvl but symbolize the skills that led them to become adventurers. The number of hidden Milestones is determined by the Character’s initial state, as detailed in the Starting Character Math. Lastly, equipment or role-playing may grant extra skills or abilities (GM’s discretion), and these may not count towards CharLvl. It’s important to note that Characters of the same “level” may have varying power levels due to this flexibility, but Tiers help otherwise ensure a more accurate match in power when gauging enemies', entry:'Game Rule (Character)' },
    { name:'Hearts and HP', desc:'In this system, every creature, object, and challenge has a Hit Point (HP) value, which reflects the Effort required to complete a task or defeat an opponent. Typically 10 HP is equivalent to 1 Heart. When rolling Effort, it determines how much HP worth of damage or effort is being applied. When dealing with damage, this value is subtracted from the HP of creatures or objects, and when dealing with challenges, it’s subtracted from that challenge’s HP. For example, a goblin with 1 HP can be defeated with a single HP of effort. Most creatures, objects, or challenges typically have 1 Heart of HP. The number of Hearts represents the level of difficulty in overcoming these obstacles. Creatures made of flesh usually have a single Base Heart, indicating their fleshy vulnerability, with additional hearts achievable through abilities, roleplay, story progression, or found loot and gear. There’s no upper limit on acquiring additional Hearts, if Characters can find or earn them. However, if the damage from a dangerous peril is significant, it will first deplete the Base Hearts, making additional Hearts irrelevant. For example, falling into lava could be such a peril. HP can also be used in place of Mana for spellcasters who have none, or martial Characters can expend it to push their limits and exert extra effort in their attacks', entry:'Game Rule (Character)' },
    { name:'Recovery and Death', desc:'On any turn in combat a player may attempt at Recovery. Rolling their CON to meet or beat the scene target may soothe their wounds and strengthen their physical resolve. Outside of combat 1 recovery may be attempted per Moment of Safety. A successful recovery in this way restores CON + 1 HP. To fully recover one must find a Place of Security for a Long Rest. If the character is injured, or the long rest was not a Place of Security, that long rest only grants them 1 recovery attempt. A long rest is a full 8 hours or even up to a day (GM’s discretion). A secure place might be a campsite but is more likely to be some sort of shelter with comforting accomodations (GM’s discretion). Players that hit 0 HP are dying. A Character cannot go below 0 HP, but being damaged double MAX HP at one time may be instant death. A player at 0 HP has their will to live sapped, their bodies are failing, and in 1d4 rounds they perish for good. Each round while dying the rolling of a 1d20 determines if they miraculously recover by rolling a 20. If they aren’t stabilized through medical intervention by another Character, then after those 1d4 rounds their soul departs their body for places unknown. The story need not end there for there are ways to return to life. But for the time being that Character is no longer playable', entry:'Game Rule (Character)' },
    { name:'Easy/Hard/Advantage/Disadvantage', desc:'Attempts are made against the target number of a scene or a significant opponent or challenge if their TN is greater (GM’s discretion). If a players attempt is EASY they get a bonus of +2, if it is hard the bonus is -2. Flat advantage is +3, and flat disadvantage is -3. When easy/hard applies and so does advantage/disadvantage, combine it with flat advantage/disadvantage. Rolled advantage is rolling twice and taking the higher number. Rolled disadvantage is taking the lower. Advantage and Disadvantage can stack if they acheived through spending Action Points in the same Category (Action Points and Attacking). Through these various bonuses or burdens, rolls are augmented by circumstance. However, if the rolled total was within 3 of the target number, the player may pay ‘the Cost’. Paying the cost is a last ditch effort to succeed, and the player must agree to the consequences. A random table determines what the cost of making that extra effort to succeed is, which can range from some unlucky burden or even death', entry:'Game Rule (Character)' },
    { name:'Focus', desc:'There are 3 kinds of focus. General Focus is the physical attention required to stay on task in the physical world. Magical Focus is the arcane focus required to maintain spells. Psionic Focus is the mental focus required to maintain psionic abilities. Unless otherwise stated, only 1 kind of focus can be given at a time. A CON (Fortitude) roll is needed to maintain focus if a Character’s HP is reduced while focusing. If focus is maintained after a failed attempt through a turn into the next turn, that attempt becomes a success', entry:'Game Rule (Character)' },
    { name:'Combat Abilities', desc:'The martial class has access to martial combat abilities including battlemaster maneuvers, weapon actions, and fighting styles. Typically these can be purchased with a Stat Point but might also be permitted through abilities. These are the martial classes equivalent of spells, fueled by Character points', entry:'Game Rule (Character)' },
    { name:'Mastery', desc:'Certain abilities or items can allow for Mastery in them. In magic disciplines Mastery are Marked by Pips. Having any Magic Discipline listed means this Character already has 1 pip in that Magic Discipline. A total of 4 Pips can be earned in any Magic Discipline. These unlock the spell level abilities required for higher level spells. Pips might also represent a decrease in casting cost for certain spells or Profiency in casting them (GM’s discretion). Individual weapons may be granted Mastery through gameplay or with a Stat Point. Mastered Weapons gain Profiency. Up to 4 Mastery can be earned in any individual weapon. Generally, Weapon Profiency applies not only to the attempt but also to the effort they produce (GM’s discretion)', entry:'Game Rule (Character)' },
    { name:'Magic Disciplines', desc:'There are 16 spell disciplines or channels through which magic can flow. Full casters start the game with 3 disciplines, and lesser casters have either 1 or 2. Upon transitioning from tier 0 to tier 1, each discipline gains 1 mastery called a pip. These disciplines flavor the spell casting, but are not otherwise mechanical outside of the mastery earned in the discipline. These disciplines can be broken down into 4 groups of 4 - [Material Magic] Charge 🜁 (lightning), Matter 🜃 (bludgeoning), Blood 🜄 (cold), Heat 🜂 (fire) [Universal Magic] Time 🝯 (radiant), Dimension ⊚ (force), Nature ⟁ (piercing), Alter 🝰 (acid). [Supernatural Metamagic] Essence 🜉 (necrotic), Mind ⛬ (psychic), Sigil ✹ (slicing), Curse ☾ (curse). [Cosmic Magic] Charm ✧ (thunder), Divine ❂ (healing), Diabolical ⛧ (disease), Elder 👁⃤ (poison). There is some overlap and exchange between all the disciplines, no magic is inherently dark or light, good or evil. They are themes around which to describe the magic done and the magic the caster can do. What kind of fireball spell might someone with essence, diabolical, or blood magic make? Doing the same damage with the same spell but flavoring it as hellfire that sucks the life out of an area is an example of the purpose of the discipline system', entry:'Game Rule (Character)' },
    { name:'Spells and Spell-like abilities', desc:'The Casting of Spells can be done by any Character, provided a few things are present. The Spell must have a vessel. In non-magical characters, this vessel is either an item or a spell scroll. In magical characters, this vessel is typically themselves. All spellcasters are refered to as Casters in ability descriptions. Some characters have spell-like abilities, like mystics and psionics. Often this will be denoted as Innate Spellcasting instead of Spellcasting. They may even describe them as being able to cast spells, but their spells are not magic, and as such can’t be counterspelled, dispelled, and the like (GM’s discretion)', entry:'Game Rule (Character)' },
    { name:'Spell Mastery and Pips', desc:'There are 5 levels of mastery per discipline: “Initiate”, “Novice”, “Competent”, “Expert”, “Master”. The 0 level initiate only knows the discipline, but has not mastered even a single pip of it yet. Mastery is indicated by a single pip next to the discipline. For instance, a Heat caster with •••• (4) total pips has the highest mastery and is a True Master of Heat Magic. Elder •• (2) would have only novice level understanding of the craft of Elder Magic. The highest Discipline Mastery a caster has is the limitation on spell availability. The more Mastery one has, the more access to more powerful spell from more disciplines one has. The total amount of spell discipline mastery is also the total points that can be spent on one casting. That is where counting the total pips becomes important. They might be a Master of Heat magic, but their additional 2 pips in Elder mean they can pay 6 points in their spell, which could be a tier 4 spell cast with 2 enhancements. SpellLvl 0(0) are easy spells to learn and master, even an Initiate can cast them without undo burden. SpellLvl 4(9) spells are only available to casters who’ve mastered at least one discipline 4 times, and earned 9 pips total. Meaning in theory, if every milestone a full caster earned went toward Spell Discipline Mastery, they would start with 3 pips spread across 3 disciplines, and would then have earn 3 milestones to master a single discipline. However to cast spells at their full POWER would take a total of 13 milestones, for a total of 16 pips across at least 4 disciplines. Higher mastery can also reduce the spell cost in points, as detailed in Spell Casting (GM’s discretion)', entry:'Game Rule (Character)' },
    { name:'Spell Casting', desc:'Casting spells requires only three things - intention, formation, and cost. The intention is possible if the caster has *some* knowledge on how casting magic works. Formation of the spell might be somatic (using gestures of the hands), verbal (with vocalizations from throat or specific soundings), include material components (which may persist after the spell or be used up in the casting of it), or other circumstances necessary (time of year, location of casting, etc.) for the casting of the spell. The cost is determined by the numbers following a spell or possibly Mastery Pips (GM’s discretion). Known spells are cast normally and cost normally. Prepared spells have reduced costs due to their preparation (materials, practice time, patron or diety power etc), and are cast normally. A prepared spell is both known and has been prepared for, which can reduce a casting cost to nothing (GM’s discretion), but each preparation is spent upon casting meaning it can only be done once per day or expended gold while shopping. To prepare a spell, the Caster must spend 100 GP on materials. Typically a Caster has at least 100 GP worth of materials for spells on hand at the start of each day. Snap Spells are so easy and well practiced a caster casts them without Cost, these are usually lower challenge spells. At Will spells are also without Cost, but might be higher challenge spells or have daily limits, and are related to the nature of the caster (GM’s discretion). On-the-Spot spells are cast with great challenge (either Hard or at Disadvantage or Both) but cost normally. These spells might also be known as Formless Casting, made up on the spot by the player with guidance by the GM. Optionally described with an action verb and a noun, as in a ‘grow carrots’ spell or ‘blast confetti’ spell. The GM will determine the cost of these Formless Casting, but often with consequences if they’re beyond the caster’s ability. Formless Casting is only available to someone with at least one Magic Discipline. Rolling a natural 20 on a Formless Spell means the Caster has learned this spell. Any spell can be cast by any one, but casting beyond a Character’s ability means magical mishaps, mutations, corruption, and injury or even death. Therefore Formless Casting should be explored at a Caster’s caution', entry:'Game Rule (Character)' },
    { name:'Spell Casting Mechanics', desc:'Casting a spell requires spending points equal to the SpellLvl cast. A SpellLvl 0(1) spell takes 1 character point to cast. As does a SpellLvl 1(2) or 1(3) spell, but with enhancements it could cost between 1 to 3 Points (GM’s discretion). A SpellLvl 2(4) spell takes 2-4 character points. To reduce the cost in character points there are a few options - Preparing ingredients to take the place of the points spent, the requirement of maintained focus for the duration of the spell, material components sacrificed for the spell’s casting, or sometimes Mastery in spell disciplines (GM’s discretion). To add POWER to a spell is to upcast it, also known as enhancement. If a spell normally does 1d10 effort, and costs 1 Point, an additional Point may make it 2d10. Any part of a spell can be modified in this way - range, duration, damage types, casting time, number of targets, area of effect, number of dice, number of faces, save to take half damage, components and their cost (GM’s discretion). This potentially makes a 4(9) spell incredibly powerful in both range or effect. Increasing POWER multiplies the cost. So a 4(9) spell cast with 4 POWER (the max amount of upcasting) is 4×4 and would cost 16 character points', entry:'Game Rule (Character)' },
    { name:'Alignment - Ethos - Reputation - Piety', desc:'This system employs a straightforward alignment system, ranging from Corruption to Purity. Engaging in virtuous deeds shifts a Character toward Purity, while acts of malevolence push them toward Corruption. The determination of what constitutes good or evil lies in the hands of the GM, who serves as the arbiter. Characters can accumulate up to 3 points in either direction on the Ethos scale, with 0 representing a neutral stance. These 7 numbers, -3 through 3, form the Ethos scale. Any points exceeding 3 in either direction contribute to the Character’s Good or Bad Reputation or their Piety. Piety acts as a form of divine currency, where accumulating more can garner the favor of the gods. On the flip side, Corruption serves as a currency for the Diabolical, who may begrudgingly acknowledge a Character with a Bad Reputation. However, regular Characters are less inclined to respect those with a negative reputation, which could lead to more hostile encounters. Conversely, a Good Reputation opens doors and eases interactions in the game world', entry:'Game Rule (Character)' },
    { name:'Sidekicks - Hirelings - Companions - Pets - Adoration', desc:'At higher levels, Characters might take on hirelings or pets and those hirelings might become Sidekicks. Adoration is the currency of hirelings. They lose adoration any time they are hurt, or are asked to do dangerous work. They gain adoration any time they are saved, treated very well, or paid in GP if they’re humanoid (or trade valued by GP). They can also be paid in Character Points, as this represents the Character making personal sacrifices for the relationship. The max amount of hirelings a Character can have are 2 per tier if a Caster, 3 per tier if a Martial Type. Sidekicks have seen the Characters work and marvel at their Heroism. The max amount of sidekicks a Character can have can have is 1, and sidekicks count towards the hireling limit. A Sidekick can do more than a hireling.

    { name:'Spell Casting Extended Mechanics', desc:'In addition to normal material and point costs to spells there are alternative ways to successfully cast magic. Some Spell-like abilities have rules specific to them, as described like the ability. They are not magic but resemble magical spells. Spell scrolls and gear can contain spells or spell-like abilities that can be cast without Cost, but the first alternative mechanical way to cast spells is called Spellburn. For a caster to use Spellburn, they bank their cost up to the max of their current proficiency dice. So a tier 1 Caster can “borrow” up to 3 Points for a spell. On the 4th SpellBurn a 1d4 is rolled and that confers damage to the Caster. Reducing Spellburn is done in the same fashion as Recovery, replacing normal Recovery with Spellburn Recovery between Moments of Safety. If a Caster finishes a Moment of Safety with Spellburn outstanding, it rolls their current proficiency dice as Spellburn damage. A second mechanic of casting is called Burning a Spell. Known spells can be successfully cast without having to roll and without Cost so long as the Caster “burns” the spell. That means they cannot cast that particular spell again until after finishing a long rest. A caster can also Burn a Pip, reducing their current level of Mastery in a Discipline to cast a spell the size of that Pip. Ritual magic is also available to those who have additional time for the casting (usually 10 minutes) to elaborately work on the formation of a spell, thereby reducing its overall cost. Finally Name Magic is available to only the most Masterful of Casters. Learning the True Name of a spell makes it possible to cast without rolling and without Cost, making it possible for any spell to become a Snap Spell. To learn a True Name of a spell one must have rolled Natural 20 in their casting of the same spell 5 times consecutively, or 20 times non-consecutively in one game session. This 20 natural 20 is spent on a True Name spell instead of on a Milestone', entry:'Game Rule (Extended)' },

The Game Master determines ethnic options for any Character from an dialectal group that has its own language or dialect, and it is assumed that Character knows their language as well as Common. This ethnic language is treated as a free additional language for such individuals. Many non-human languages exist. Speaking them may not be possible for a human throat, so knowing them may only extend to understanding them and not speaking them. Other languages like plant-tongue are so slow as to not be useful to speak in game, and some languages like Myconid are spoken chemically and imperceptable to all but them', entry:'Game Rule (World)' },
    { name:'Difficult Terrain', desc:'Combat rarely takes place in bare rooms or on featureless plains. Boulder-strewn caverns, briar-choked forests, treacherous staircases—the setting of a typical fight contains difficult terrain. Every unit of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra unit. This rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult terrain. Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain. The space of another creature, whether hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain', entry:'Game Rule (World)' },
    { name:'Being Prone', desc:'Combatants often find themselves lying on the ground, either because they are knocked down or because they throw themselves down. In the game, they are prone. Drop prone without using any of speed. Standing up takes more effort an amount of movement equal to half movement speed. If there isn’t enough movement left or if speed is 0, this Character can’t stand. To move while prone, crawl or use magic such as teleportation. Every unit of movement while crawling costs 1 extra unit. Crawling 1 unit in difficult terrain, therefore, costs 3 units of movement', entry:'Game Rule (World)' },
    { name:'Falling', desc:'Falling from a great height is a significant risk for adventurers and their foes. At the end of a fall, the Character takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10’ the Character fell, to a max of 20d6. The Character lands prone, unless somehow avoiding taking damage from the fall. Here are two optional rules that expand on that simple rule. The rule for falling assumes that a creature immediately drops the entire distance when it falls. But what if a creature is at a high altitude when it falls, perhaps on the back of a griffon or on board an airship? Realistically, a fall from such a height can take more than a few seconds, extending past the end of the turn when the fall occurred. High-altitude falls to be properly time-consuming, use the following optional rule. When the Character falls from a great height, they descend 250’ per turn for a Medium creature. If they’re still falling on their next turn, their speed of descent increases by 250’ per turn up to a max speed of 1000’. This process continues until the fall ends, either because they hit the ground or the fall is otherwise halted. A size bigger drops twice as fast, and doubles for each size beyond that. Small size creatures fall 125’ per turn. Tiny or smaller creatures lose half their HP falling any distance greater than 10’. A flying creature in flight falls if it is knocked prone, if its speed is reduced to 0’, or if it otherwise loses the ability to move, unless it can hover or it is being held aloft by magic, such as the fly spell. A flying creature has a better chance of surviving a fall than a non-flying creature does: subtract the creature’s current flying speed from the distance it fell before calculating falling damage. This rule is helpful to a flier that is knocked prone but is still conscious and has a current flying speed that is greater than 0’. The rule is designed to simulate the creature flapping its wings furiously or taking similar measures to slow the velocity of its fall. If using the rule for rate of falling in the previous section, a flying creature descends 250’ on the turn when it falls, just as other creatures do. But if that creature starts any of its later turns still falling and is prone, it can halt the fall on its turn by spending half its flying speed to counter the prone condition (as if it were standing up in midair)', entry:'Game Rule (World)' },
    { name:'Madness', desc:'In a typical campaign, Characters aren’t driven mad by the horrors they face and the carnage they inflict day after day, but sometimes the stress of being an adventurer can be too much to bear. If a campaign has a strong horror theme, use madness as a way to reinforce that theme, emphasizing the extraordinarily horrific nature of the threats the adventurers face. Various magical effects can inflict madness on an otherwise stable mind. Certain spells, such as contact other plane and symbol, can cause insanity, so using the madness rules here instead of the spell effects listed is warranted. Diseases, poisons, and planar effects such as psychic wind or the howling winds of Pandemonium can all inflict madness. Some artifacts can also break the psyche of a Character who uses or becomes attuned to them. Resisting a madness-inducing effect usually requires a WIS or CHA save. If a game includes SAN, a creature makes a Sanity save instead. Madness can be short-term, long-term, or indefinite. Most relatively mundane effects impose short-term madness, which lasts for just a few minutes. More horrific effects or cumulative effects can result in long-term or indefinite madness. A Character afflicted with short-term madness is subjected to an effect for 1d10 minutes. A Character afflicted with long-term madness is subjected to an effect 1d10 × 10 hours. A Character afflicted with indefinite madness gains a new Character flaw until cured. A calm emotions spell can suppress the effects of madness, while a lesser restoration spell can rid a Character of a short-term or long-term madness. Depending on the source of the madness, remove curse or dispel evil might also prove effective. A greater restoration spell or more powerful magic is required to rid a Character of indefinite madness', entry:'Game Rule (World)' },

Found at almost every level of the hierarchy, and while technically still part of it, Mutant Devils (Xeno) have reached a plateau in their ascent. Demotion is the only direction they can move, leading to unique and fascinating devolutions. These devils struggle to maintain their precarious positions, desperately clinging to their place within the hierarchy. Assassin Devils (Dogai) and Dragon Devils (Abishai) exist both within and outside the hierarchy. The rest are loosely organized as - [Least Devils] Assassin Devils (Dogai), Lamentors (Gulthir), Blind Eyes (Nupperibo), Squidges (Lemure), Spined Devils (Spinagon) [Lesser Devils] Maw Devils (Ghargatula), Frog Devils (Nergaliid), Dragon Devils (Abishai), Legion Devils (Merregon), Death Devils (Jerul), Bearded Devils (Barbazu), Tormentor Devils (Kocrachon), Furies (Erinyes), Pain Devils (Excruciarch), Chain Devils (Kytons), Hunter Devils (Orthon), War Devils (Malebranches), Bone Devils (Osyluth), Barbed or Stony Devils (Hamatulas) [Greater Devils] Horned Devils (Cornugon), Wasp Devils (Advespa), Styx Devils (Amnizu), Hell Knights (Narzugon), True Name Devils (Logokron), Mad Devils (Xerfilstyx), Ice Devils (Gelugon), Corruption Devils (Paeliryon), Prime Vassal Devils (Pit Fiend). At the highest tier are the Dukes & Duchesses and the Archdevils of Hell, each having unique forms as diverse as their personalities', entry:'Game Rule (World)' },
    { name:'Closed Domain', desc:'If a Domain’s borders are closed, supernatural agitation is obvious to any who approach the Mists. This takes the form of roiling disturbances within the haze, menacing silhouettes, threatening sounds, or other activity themed to the domain.

This exhaustion can’t be removed while the creature is in the Mists. No matter how far a creature travels in the Mists, or which direction it goes, it gets turned around so that it eventually ends up back in the domain it left. Dark Forces can keep their domains’ borders closed indefinitely and can reopen them at will. For some Dark Forces, slightly varied effects manifest when they close their domains. Others are limited in their ability to affect their borders.

    { name:'Chain Lightning Game', desc:'Chain Lightning is a game in which two teams of six players compete against each other. To win, a team must eliminate the other team’s players by hitting them with a ⅒’ diameter iron ball. A player struck by the thrown ball is eliminated and teleported to the sidelines. The game ends when all of one team’s players have been eliminated. When the game begins, an “iron ball” magically appears in a random location on the arena floor roughly equidistant from the two teams. To simulate a game of Chain Lightning, follow these steps: Step 1. Every player makes a DEX (Athletics) roll. The individual with the highest roll gets the ball, and that person’s team is on offense. Resolve a tie with a STR (Athletics) contest. Step 2. To simulate the ball being passed around, every player makes a TN 15 DEX (Athletics) roll. If the team on offense gets more successes than the team on defense, one player on offense can try either to hurl the ball between the metal tines of an electrified mast, hoping to impart an electrical charge to the ball, or make a ranged weapon attack with the ball against a player on defense. Each option is described below: Hurling the ball between the tines of an electrified mast requires a successful ranged attack roll against DEF +5. If this attack hits, the ball becomes electrically charged as it passes between the tines. Repeat step 1 to determine which team gets custody of the electrically charged ball. If the ball is thrown at a player on defense and it hits, the player struck by the ball is eliminated. If the ball is electrically charged when it hits, it deals additional lightning damage to the eliminated player, and an arc of lightning shoots from the ball and automatically hits another randomly determined player on the same team. This second player takes lightning damage and is also eliminated. If the ball is thrown at a player and it misses, it loses its electrical charge if it has one.

    { name:'Deck Rules: Tarokka', desc:'The Vistani have long been masters of fortune-telling. In the hands of a Vistani seer, a deck of tarokka cards can tell tales of the future and provide answers to many a dark and mysterious question. Although the workmanship and artistic quality of the cards can vary from deck to deck, the ability of the cards to call forth information about the future is far more valuable than the monetary worth of a deck. Anyone can craft a deck of tarokka cards, but only someone of Vistani blood can imbue the cards with the gift of prophecy. Once they are crafted and empowered, they must be stored in accordance with ancient tradition, or they lose their efficacy. When not in use, tarokka cards must be wrapped in silk and stored in a wooden box. A tarokka deck has fifty-four cards, each of which has its own name. Forty of them comprise the common deck, which is divided into four suits: ♠ swords, ♦ coins, ♣ stars, and ♥ glyphs. Each suit contains cards numbered one through nine, plus a tenth card that is called the master of that suit. A card can be referred to by its suit designation or by its name. For instance, the three of glyphs is also known as the healer, and the wizard card is also known as the master of stars. The remaining fourteen cards make up the high deck, which symbolizes the natural forces of the multiverse. These cards are represented by a crown symbol and are the most powerful cards in the deck. [High Deck] The cards that compose the high deck aren’t considered to be one suit, although they are often denoted with a crown icon to mark their importance. Rather, each card is an important power in its own right. If one of these cards comes out in a casting and seems to contradict the prediction of an earlier card, the Vistani always assume that this card takes precedence. [Common Deck] The four suits and their respective cards are described in more detail: [Swords] This suit symbolizes aggression and violence. It is the suit of warriors, be they paladins, soldiers, mercenaries, or gladiators. It also symbolizes the power of governments and leaders, whether noble or corrupt. [Stars] This suit symbolizes the desire for personal power and control over things beyond the ken of mortals. It is the suit of arcane mages, sages, and intellectuals. It also represents the triumph of magic, science, and reason over religion, mysticism, and superstition. [Coins] This suit symbolizes avarice and the desire for personal and material gain. It is also symbolic of gluttony, lust, and obsession. On the side of good, this suit can suggest the accumulation of wealth for the benefit of a charity or a just cause. On the side of evil, it embodies the worst aspects of greed. It speaks to the power of gold, and how that power can build or destroy nations. [Glyphs] This suit symbolizes faith, spirituality, and inner strength. It is the suit of priests and those who devote themselves to the service of a deity, a higher power, or a heightened philosophy. On the side of good, it represents willpower and dedication. On the side of evil, the suit signifies weakness of Character, self-doubt, and betrayal of one’s ideals or beliefs. It symbolizes health and healing, as well as illness and disease', entry:'Game Rule (World)' },
    { name:'Tarokka Reading: King Vampire', desc:'When ready to begin the card reading, remove the fourteen cards with the crown icon (the high deck) and shuffle them.

Then draw the top two cards from the high deck and lay them face down in the 4 and 5 positions. Drawn from the high deck, the fourth card in the card reading determines the location of an NPC who can improve the Characters’ chances of defeating King Vampire. (Some cards offer two possible results) King Vampire senses that this NPC is a danger to him and tries to eliminate the threat as quickly as possible. This NPC, whoever it ends up being, gains the following additional action - Inspire. While within sight of King Vampire, this Character grants inspiration to one player Character he or she can see. Drawn from the high deck, the fifth card in the card reading determines the location of the final showdown with King Vampire — the place in Castle Ravenloft where the Characters are sure to find him. The first time the Characters arrive at the foretold location, King Vampire is there, provided he hasn’t been forced back into his coffin. Each of the NPCs described in this section has a role to play in the adventure, even if that individual isn’t indicated in the card reading.

    { name:'Tool Rules: Complex Tasks', desc:'Tools and/or complex systems can be represented as mini-games where the relevant base stat and proficiency offer opportunities for re-rolling from a dice pool. Consider a lockpicking exercise as an example. Instead of using a TN based on a 1d20, we convert the value to represent the task’s complexity: TN 5 becomes 2, TN 10 becomes 4, TN 15 becomes 6, TN 20 becomes 8, TN 25 becomes 10, and TN 30 becomes 12. Time intervals could reflect the same, with increments of 6 seconds each (1 round per complexity). So, if a player Character encounters a complex lock with a difficulty of 20, they roll 1d6 six times. If any dice show a 1, they may reroll a number of times equal to their proficiency or up to their modifier, whichever is greater. If they fail the minigame roll for 6 rounds, they automatically succeed, as this was sufficient time to complete the task. This mini-game could be adjusted to any task of any complexity by multiplying or dividing the TN equivalency to produce an appropriate number of dice rolls, ensuring an engaging gameplay experience.
